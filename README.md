# Terminal Ticket Queue Management

PROJECT IDEA
During the pandemic of covid-19, we realize that Terminal Machine we currently use to request ticket for waiting queue, was no more update 
with the current situation or scenario. And our idea was update this type of machine.

DESCRIPTION
This project is developed in QT5 14 and QML.
An Intel processor provided in the UP BOARD is responsible for running the qt/qml Embedded application.
We describe the complete solution as a smart waiting queue management system used in health care system.
The innovation feature of this product is that we replace the printed ticket by a digital ticket generated by a QR code.
With this solution, the user can get the ticket on their smart phone and following the queue anywhere he/she is sitting...

BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE
For the business perspective, we can say that the advantage of our solution is that we remove the print machine, which generates extra costs with paper and maintenance.
